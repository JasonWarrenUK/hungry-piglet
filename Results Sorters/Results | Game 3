        -   (Result_111) Look, here's the thing. 
            I'm not even certain it's possible to see this ending. 
        
            +       To see this, you need to have...

            +++     getting the worst possible result 
            ++++    on every playthrough.
                            
        -   And this is in a game where some of the bad choices disappear once you've picked them.
                            
            +   I mean[...], in some ways this is an achievement.
                            
            ++  [...] Yes. An achievement.

            +   So...
            
        -   I don't want you to feel bad, but by this point in the game you could be seeing one of twenty-one different endings.
            
            +   Do you know where this one ranks? 
            
        -   Twentieth.

            You have now held the cracker.
                            
                            It's possible, with supreme effort, that this next attempt will see you overcome the greatest test.
                            
                            I refer, of course, to popping the dastardly biccie into your gob.

                            It's a little early to rest on your laurels and revisit past glories. 
                            I know we're very proud that we managed to see the cracker on the second attempt, but repeating that achievement is, perhaps, a trifle unambitious.

                            This might help motivate you; you're progressing as slowly as is possible, other than not making progress at all.
                            
                            Maybe we could... get a bit of a trot on?

                            No, see you've gotten complacent. You can't just repeatedly hold the cracker, you have to eat it.
                            
                            You know. Eating. Like... holding it with your mouth?

                            After an initial failure, you managed to hold a cracker... and now, you've gone back to not holding a cracker. 
                            
                            Shall we try again?

                            After an inauspicious start, you've now managed the very difficult task of holding a savoury snack twice. 
                            
                            I think that, if you try really hard, you can get it from the trotter to the mouth. 
                            
                            I believe in you.
