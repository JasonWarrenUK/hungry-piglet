    -   (Result_11X) That is twice in a row that you have not seen the cracker lying on the floor. //NP
                        
        And frankly that is unacceptapig. //NP

    -   (Result_12X) YOU LOSE! //NP
                        
        You did not even hold that lovely cracker that you saw between your trotters, let alone munch it. //NP
            -> LoopStart
    
    -   (Result_13X) Meanwhile, I looked at the cracker. //NP
                        
        SO CLOSE! You had a cracker this time, but you did not munch it.

    -   (Result_21X) Last time, you at least saw the cracker. //NP
                        
        This time, not even that. //NP
                    
        Shameful. //NP
                        
        Shameful. //NP

    -   (Result_22X) The cracker isn't going to hurt you. //NP
                        
        Don't just look at it, get it! //NP
                        
        Munch it! //NP
            -> LoopStart

    -   (Result_23X) This is a definite improvement. //NP
                        
        You have now actually held that lovely cracker in your worthy trots. //NP
                        
        Now. To the munchy face. One last final push. //NP
            -> LoopStart

    -   (Result_31X) What happened? //NP
                        
        Did you forget how to pick things up? //NP
                        
        How careless. //NP
            -> LoopStart

    -   (Result_32X) Right, you actually did worse this time. //NP
                        
        You went from holding a cracker (but not eating it) to struggling with the very concept of holding a cracker. //NP
            -> LoopStart

    -   (Result_33X) Meanwhile, I looked at the cracker. //NP
                        
        Right, I just want to check... //NP
                
        You know you need to eat the cracker, right? //NP
                        
        Like, actually eat it. //NP
                        
        Not just hold it. //NP
