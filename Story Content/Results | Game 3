                            Look, here's the thing. 
                            I'm not even certain it's possible to see this ending. 
                            To see this, you need to have
                            
                            played three times, 
                            getting the worst possible result 
                            on every playthrough.
                            
                            And this is in a game where some of the bad choices disappear once you've picked them.
                            
                            I mean... in some ways this is an achievement.
                            
                            ...
                            
                            Yes.
                            An achievement.
                            
                            Tell you what, this is painful. 
                            Let's say you won... 
                            in, 
                            like... 
                            your own special way.

                            I don't want you to feel bad, 
                            but by this point in the game you could be seeing one of twenty-one different endings.
                            Do you know where this one ranks?

                            Okay, so we appear to have chiselled a crack into the boulder that is your brain.
                            
                            You have now held the cracker.
                            
                            It's possible, with supreme effort, that this next attempt will see you overcome the greatest test.
                            
                            I refer, of course, to popping the dastardly biccie into your gob.

                            It's a little early to rest on your laurels and revisit past glories.
